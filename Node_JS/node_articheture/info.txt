If we have 4 workers and if all they are busy and we have used all blocking 
operations than the code stops working because all our workers are busy 
So it is good to use the non blocking operations in the code 


Sync is the blocking operation while Async is the non-blocking operation

Example

Sync -> this will execute from the top the bottom and 2 will not print the read file is completed.
console.lg(1);
fs.readfileSync();
console.lg(2);

Async -> this will complete all the task till file read is working and when its result is ready than it will print that for us.
console.lg(1);
fs.readfileSync();
console.lg(2);
console.lg(4);

that is why non blocking operation are good to use


const os=require("os");//this will give the info of our opersting system
 console.log(os.cpus().length);// I have 12 threads
